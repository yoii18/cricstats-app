# CricStats 
This website uses open-source data from [cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/) to get some insights on players. 

I specifically use IPL data right now for the ease of execution and also because of database size limitations but I plan on adding more matches and tournaments eventually.

This website uses:
- NodeJS for backend
- ReactJS for frontend
- PostgreSQL as Database
